* <b>Legend Issues</b>
Did have some problems getting the Legend in Plot 3 and lower left graph of plot 4
to fit within the boundaries of the box when using RStudio.

Tried various parameter changes to fix this issue with no luck.

Discussion forum entry supplied the fix - use R rather than RStudio: need to look
into whether the version of RStudiop is the issue.
